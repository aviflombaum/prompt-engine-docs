   ```

### 2. Extract the Files

   Extract the downloaded `.zip` file to your desired location:

   ```

### 3. Run the Installer

   Navigate to the installation directory:

   ```
   install.exe
   ```

   For MacOS/Linux, make the script executable and run it:

   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

## Database Setup

### 1. Create a Database

   - **MySQL:**
     ```
     CREATE DATABASE promptengine_db;
     ```

   - **PostgreSQL:**
     ```
     createdb promptengine_db;
     ```

### 2. Configure Database Access

   Edit the `database.config` file in the installation directory to include your database credentials:
   ```ini
   [database]
   host=localhost
   port=3306
   user=yourusername
   password=yourpassword
   dbname=promptengine_db
   ```

## Configuration Options

Configure PromptEngine by editing the `config.ini` file located in the root of the installation directory. Common configurations include:

- **Server Port:**
  ```ini
  [server]
  port=8080
  ```

- **Logging Level:**
  ```ini
  [logging]
  level=info
  ```

- **Max Processes:**
  ```ini
  [system]
  max_processes=4
  ```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Installation Fails Due to Permissions

   Ensure you have the necessary permissions to install applications on your system. On Unix systems, running the installer with `sudo` can resolve these issues.

### 2. Database Connection Errors

   Verify that the database is running and accessible. Check your `database.config` for accurate credentials and connection details.

### 3. Missing Dependencies

   If you encounter errors regarding missing libraries or dependencies, install them using your systemâ€™s package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install libmissing
   ```

### 4. Configuration File Not Found

   Ensure that `config.ini` is in the correct directory and readable. Verify the file's path and permissions.

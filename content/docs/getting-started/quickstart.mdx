# Getting Started with PromptEngine

This guide will help you get PromptEngine integrated into your Rails application quickly. You'll be managing AI prompts through a beautiful admin interface in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

<Callout type="info">
  Before starting, ensure you have:
  - Ruby 3.0 or higher
  - Rails 8.0.2 or higher
  - PostgreSQL or MySQL database
  - API keys for OpenAI or Anthropic (for playground features)
</Callout>

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Add PromptEngine to your Gemfile
    
    ```ruby
    gem 'prompt_engine'
    ```
    
    Then run bundle install to install the gem:
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Mount the engine in your routes
    
    Add this line to your `config/routes.rb`:
    
    ```ruby
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      mount PromptEngine::Engine => "/prompt_engine"
      
      # Your other routes...
    end
    ```
    
    This makes the admin interface available at `/prompt_engine` in your application.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Install and run migrations
    
    Copy the engine's migrations to your application:
    
    ```bash
    bin/rails prompt_engine:install:migrations
    ```
    
    Then run the migrations:
    
    ```bash
    bin/rails db:migrate
    ```
    
    This creates the necessary tables for prompts, versions, and parameters.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Configure API credentials
    
    PromptEngine needs API keys to test prompts in the playground. Edit your Rails credentials:
    
    ```bash
    rails credentials:edit
    ```
    
    Add your API keys:
    
    ```yaml
    # For OpenAI
    openai:
      api_key: sk-your-openai-key
      
    # For Anthropic
    anthropic:
      api_key: sk-ant-your-anthropic-key
    ```
    
    <Callout type="warning">
      Keep your API keys secure! Never commit them to version control.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Start your Rails server
    
    ```bash
    rails server
    ```
    
    Visit `http://localhost:3000/prompt_engine` to access the admin interface.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Migrations are failing">
    Ensure your database is created and accessible. You may need to run:
    ```bash
    rails db:create
    ```
    before running migrations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't access /prompt_engine">
    1. Check that you've mounted the engine in routes.rb
    2. Restart your Rails server after making route changes
    3. Ensure you're using the correct port (usually 3000)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Playground isn't working">
    The playground requires API credentials. Make sure you've:
    1. Added API keys to Rails credentials
    2. Restarted your server after adding credentials
    3. Have valid, active API keys

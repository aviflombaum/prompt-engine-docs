# Understanding PromptEngine's Version Control System

Version control is essential for managing changes to your application's source code over time. PromptEngine's version control system provides an automatic mechanism for tracking revisions, making it easier to manage updates, fix bugs, and collaborate with other developers.

## How Automatic Versioning Works

Every time you commit changes to your project, PromptEngine automatically increments the version number. This automated process ensures that every change set is tracked and uniquely identifiable, facilitating easier rollback and issue tracking.

## Viewing Version History

You can view the complete version history of your project through the PromptEngine dashboard. This allows you to see a timeline of changes, who made each change, and what changes were made.

## Comparing Versions

When you need to understand the differences between two versions, our version comparison tool comes in handy. Here's how you can utilize it:

<Tabs items={['Text Comparison', 'Code Difference Viewer']}>
  <Tab value="Text Comparison">
    This tool allows you to see line-by-line changes in a simple text format, making it easy to identify what was added or removed.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Code Difference Viewer">
    Ideal for code changes, this viewer highlights syntax changes and can filter out files that haven't changed, focusing on the modifications that matter.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Restoring Previous Versions

If you need to revert to a previous version of your project, follow these steps:

## Version Management Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
  Regularly commit your changes to ensure that every modification is captured in the version history. This practice makes it easier to track down when specific changes were made.
</Callout>

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why Use Meaningful Commit Messages?">
    Meaningful commit messages serve as a brief explanation of the changes made, which helps team members understand the purpose of each modification without reviewing the full code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to Handle Merge Conflicts">
    When encountering merge conflicts, manually review the affected code sections and decide whether to keep your changes, accept incoming changes, or merge the two. Testing after resolving conflicts is crucial.
  </Accordion>

By following these guidelines and using PromptEngine's robust version control tools, your development process will be smoother and more manageable.

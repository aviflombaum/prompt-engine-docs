# Getting Started with PromptEngine

This guide will help you get PromptEngine integrated into your Rails application quickly. You'll be managing AI prompts through a beautiful admin interface in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

<Callout type="info">
Before starting, ensure you have:  
  - Ruby 3.0 or higher
  - Rails 7+ (currently PromptEngine has been tested with Rails 8+)
  - API keys for OpenAI or Anthropic (for playground features)
</Callout>

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Add PromptEngine to your Gemfile
    
    ```bash
    bundle add prompt_engine
    ```

    ```ruby
    gem 'prompt_engine'
    ```
    
    _You can also use `prompt_engine` from the [GitHub Source](http://github.com/aviflombaum/prompt_engine/) as the gem is in very active development._

    ```ruby
    gem "prompt_engine", git: "https://github.com/aviflombaum/prompt_engine.git"
    ```

    Then run bundle install to install the gem:
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Install and run migrations
    
    Install the migrations from the gem by running:
    
    ```bash
    bin/rails prompt_engine:install:migrations
    ```
    
    You will see the migrations copied to your `db/migrations`.

    Then run the migrations:
    
    ```bash
    bin/rails db:migrate
    ```
    
    This creates the necessary tables for prompts, versions, and parameters.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Mount the engine in your routes
    
    Add this line to your `config/routes.rb`:
    
    ```ruby
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      mount PromptEngine::Engine => "/prompt_engine"
      
      # Your other routes...
    end
    ```
    
    This makes the admin interface available at `/prompt_engine` in your application.
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Configure API credentials
    
    Currently, PromptEngine only needs your LLM provider's API key to run Test Runs of your Prompts in the Playground. You will be able to supply an API Key when you run a test or you can save your API Keys in the PromptEngine Setting Page where they will be stored and **encrypted** in the database.

    <Callout type="info">
      In a future release, you will be able to piggyback off where you normally might store your LLM provider's keys, such as in your Rails Credentials files or your `ENV`.
    </Callout>
    
    <Callout type="warning">
      Keep your API keys secure! Never commit them to version control.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Start your Rails server
    
    ```bash
    rails server
    ```
    
    Visit `http://localhost:3000/prompt_engine` to access the admin interface.
